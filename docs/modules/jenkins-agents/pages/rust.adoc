= Rust Jenkins agent

== Introduction
This agent is used to build / execute Rust code and tools.

The image is built in the global `ods` project and is named `jenkins-agent-rust`.
It can be referenced in a `Jenkinsfile` with `ods/jenkins-agent-rust`.

== Default MSRV and Edition
Rust installation is managed by `rustup`, which offers a convenient way to load and manage Rust versions automatically.

And, the version defined in the `rust-toolchain` file is the one that the Jenkins Agent will use (even if it is not the default). That file MUST be in the root of the projects' repository.

Default Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) **1.88**.

Default Rust edition in use is **2024**. See https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/introduction.html[Rust Edition Guide] for further information.

== Features
The image contains the following tools:

* Rust toolchain (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install[Rustup])

* Rust compiler (https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/[Rustc])

* Rust package manager (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/[Cargo])

* Rust Next generation test runner (https://nexte.st/[Cargo Nextest])

* Rust code coverage (https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov[Cargo LLVM Coverage])

* Rust code generation (https://cargo-generate.github.io/cargo-generate/[Cargo Generate])

== Known limitations
By default, no Nexus repository/registry nor mirror available for Rust packages and dependencies (only available in https://help.sonatype.com/en/rust-cargo.html[Nexus Pro from version 3.73.0] and/or https://help.sonatype.com/en/ce-onboarding.html[Nexus Community from version 3.77.0]). If not having Nexus Pro v3.37.0+, one can use git repositories or local file system to store and reference Rust packages and dependencies.
