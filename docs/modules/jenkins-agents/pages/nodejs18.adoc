= Node.js 18 - Jenkins agent (removed)

This agent has been removed because Node.js 18 reached its end-of-life on 2025-04-30 and is no longer maintained.

If you previously used `jenkins-agent-nodejs18`, please migrate your Jenkinsfiles and pipeline configurations to a supported Node.js agent (for example `jenkins-agent-nodejs20` or `jenkins-agent-nodejs22`).

See the Jenkins agents index for available, supported images.
