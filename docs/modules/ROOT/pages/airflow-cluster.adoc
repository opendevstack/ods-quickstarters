= AirFlow Openshift Cluster Boilerplate

This boilerplate provides an Airflow Cluster using Kubernetes Executor
hosted in Openshift.

== Setup

The AirFlow Cluster setup that is provided is based on the KubernetesExecutor and will
create and destroy worker pods on demand. It also setup an ElasticSearch instance as the log
repository for all workers. As illustrated bellow:

image::Airflow Architecture Diagram.png?raw=true[Airflow Architecture]

All Airflow images are based on your `<project_id>-cd/airflow` image stream.

All documentation regarding the base images used in this quickstarter can be found at
https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/tree/master/airflow-cluster/base-images[airflow-cluster/base-images]

To deploy the quickstarter *the component name must be `airflow-worker`* otherwise nothing will be created

== Contents

These are the OpenShift resources and the repository structure created by
this boilerplace. *Nothing will be created if any rersouces in the target
OpenShift namespace can be found under the label `cluster=airflow`*

=== OpenShift Resources

This boilerplate create several resources in OpenShift and *ALL* of them
can be found using the label `cluster=airflow`. The created resources are:

* Service Account:
 ** `airflow` : Service account used as OAuth client for the Airflow web server
* Secrets:
 ** `airflow-postgresql` : Credentials for the PostgreSQL database
 ** `airflow-elasticsearch` : Credentials for the ElasticSearch
 ** `airflow-fernetkey` : Fernet key for securing stored Airflow Connection
* Config Maps:
 ** `airflow-environemnt` : Airflow configuration shared among all nodes
* Builds and Image Stream:
 ** `airflow-worker` : Worker image which Airflow uses for executing the tasks
* Deployment Configs and Services:
 ** `airflow-webserver` : Airflow Web Server
 ** `airflow-scheduler` : Airflow Scheduler (* Only Deployment Config)
 ** `airflow-postgresql` :  Airflow matadata database
 ** `airflow-elasticsearch`: Worker log database
 ** `airflow-kibana`: Interface for exploring Airflow logs in ElasticSearch
* Routes:
 ** `airflow-webserver` : Exposes Airflow webserver

=== Examples

All examples files are simple examples and they are only needed for guiding the first development steps.
They can be deleted!

== Features

=== Multi Branching

An Airflow cluster will be created in each environment. This allows the DAG development to follow the
same branching strategy adopted in the whole project

=== CI/CD

All commited code is submitted to a CI/CD pipeline defined in Jenkinsfile. This pipeline executes
DAG integrity tests, which prevents invalid DAGs to be deployed. It also enables the development of
all sort of tests needed for development.

=== DAG Distribution

The last step of the Jenkins pipeline is to synchorized the recent commited DAGs with the
Airflow web server and Airflow scheduler

== Configuration of Airflow

The configuration of all deployments is documented in https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/tree/master/airflow-cluster/base-images/airflow[Airflow base-images] folder in ods-quickstarters/airflow-cluster

NOTE: once the cluster is provisioned in OpenShift you need to change in the `airflow-environment` configmap any occurence of the following strings:
- `your-openshift-apihost`
- `your-openshift-console`
to the right values for your cluster. Finally, redeploy `airflow-webserver` and `airflow-scheduler` to apply the configurations.
