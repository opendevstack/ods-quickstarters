=== Metadata

The following are typical xref:quickstarters:metadata.adoc[metadata] values that can be used for components based on this quickstarter:
Note that the xref:jenkins-shared-library:labelling.adoc[OpenShift resources will be labeled] based on this metadata.

```yaml
name: <the component id (this is the default, if omitted)>
description: "My Angular-based front end"
supplier: https://example.com
version: 1.0.1
type: ods
role: frontend
runtime: angular-cli
runtimeVersion: 19.1.4
```

== How this quickstarter is built through Jenkins

The build pipeline is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` in the project root. The main stages of the pipeline are:

* stageBuild - Builds the application by running `npm install`, `npm run build` command and copies output folder `dist` into `docker/dist` folder.
* stageUnitTest - Runs unit test cases by executing command `npm run test`. This will also create test coverage analysis data which will then be transfered to SonarQube during odsComponentStageScanWithSonar
* odsComponentStageScanWithSonar - Triggers a code quality analysis by transfering code and test coverage analysis data to SonarQube. By default files like `*.spec.ts`, `*.modules.ts` and `src/environments/**` are excluded from the analysis, since they usually don't contain logic. Please revisit `sonar-project.properties` to configure analysis inclusions and exclusions according to your project's needs.

Please note: By default the applciation is always build as full production build including all sorts of optimizations. In addition source maps will be added except for builds that are triggered from `master`. This can be changed by configuring (additional) build configurations within `angular.json` and by using them via stageBuild or `package.json`.

Please note: The support for *TSLint* has been removed from this quickstarter. Also Angular is not shipping a linter by default anymore. Please consider adding *ESLint* support or a formatter like *Prettier*. For adding ESLint simply type `ng add @angular-eslint/schematics`. For setting up Prettier please see https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html.
