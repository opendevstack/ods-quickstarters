= Backend Rust Axum Quickstarter (be-rust-axum)

The project supports generation of https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust] programming language based projects, with the https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/[Axum] web framework by default,
and quick installation and integration within OpenShift Jenkins CICD pipelines within the [OpenDevStack](https://www.opendevstack.org/) context.

For Database/Postgres integration it is recommended to use https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/[SQLx]. Check the https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/tree/main/examples/postgres/axum-social-with-tests/[Axum with SQLx] example. Enjoy a full async, safe and high performant setup!

== Purpose of this quickstarter

This is a Rust project with a common Rust project folder and files structure, with its `main.rs` file for the final binary to be built, and that makes use of the `lib.rs` file, which exposes the crates (AKA modules or packages) of the project (where the business logic happens). Similar to Python project structures.

The quickstarter comes with a simple API-server example written in https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust] and using the https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/[Axum] web framework.
The package allows to easily build a Rust project, using different Rust crates (packages).
It contains the basic setup for Docker, Jenkins, SonarQube and OpenShift.

**NOTE** The project can be also extended to build other types of solutions with, for example, https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm/[WASM] or https://esp-rs.github.io/book/introduction.html[IoT].

== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

The project is production ready when deployed in OpenShift.

Rust community and official resources are great to get to it, see
https://www.rust-lang.org/learn[learn Rust].

To get Rust ready on your local environment you just require installing `rustup` (see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install[install Rust])

[source,bash]
----
# Get the Rustup CLI and already install target computer toolchain and latest stable Rust version
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# If you are new to Rust (also check the rustlings TUI)
rustup doc --book

# Run Unit, Integration and Documentation tests in isolated processes on each test
cargo install cargo-nextest  # install nextest!
cargo nextest run

# Cargo format source code
cargo fmt

# Cargo run locally
cargo run

# Cargo run Rust linters
cargo clippy

# Cargo generate documentation
cargo doc [--document-private-items] --open
----

One can also extend the `cargo` features by installing `cargo` extensions like:
[source,bash]
----
# Live reload locally
cargo install cargo-watch  # https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch
# Then you can live reload by:
cargo watch -x run

# Audit Cargo.lock against the advisory DB. The [RustSec Advisory Database](https://github.com/rustsec/rustsec) is a repository of security advisories filed against Rust crates published via crates.io.
cargo install cargo-audit
#Â Audit you dependencies on Licenses, Bans, Advisories and Sources, with [cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny)
cargo install cargo-deny
# ...

== How this quickstarter is built through Jenkins

The Jenkinsfile is provisioned with this quick starter to ease CI/CD process. In Jenkinsfile, there are various stages:

* *Cargo Check* - Checks we can compile:
+
[source,bash]
----
  cargo check --all-targets
----

* *Cargo Format* - Checks code is properly formatted:
+
[source,bash]
----
  cargo fmt --all -- --check
----

* *Cargo Clippy* - Collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code (output is also used on SonarQube reports):
+
[source,bash]
----
  cargo clippy --all-features
----

* *Cargo Deny* - Collection of lints to catch dependency graph issues related to licenses, bans, advisories and sources:
+
[source,bash]
----
  cargo deny --all-features check
----

* *Cargo Test* - Runs nextest (instead of `cargo test`, see above why) with xUnit test report generation (see .config/nextest.toml) and code coverage reports with LLVM coverage tool:
+
[source,bash]
----
  cargo nextest run --profile ci
  cargo llvm-cov nextest --profile ci --lcov
----

* *Build* - Builds the release target binary and moves it to the docker folder:
+
[source,bash]
----
  cargo build --release
----

== Builder agent used

This quickstarter uses https://www.opendevstack.org/ods-documentation/opendevstack/latest/jenkins-agents/rust.html[Rust] Jenkins builder agent.

**NOTE**: The ODS Jenkins Rust Agent supports Rust versions 1.83.x, and depending on project's dependencies it can also handle Minor Rust versions above and below the supported one.

See the docker spec and openshift templates https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/tree/master/common/jenkins-agents/rust[here].

== Technologies in use

The following main Rust technologies are in use when running this boilerplate:

- https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum[Axum]: Web application framework that focuses on ergonomics and modularity.
- https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio[Tokio]: Runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications.
- https://github.com/tower-rs/tower[Tower]: Library of modular and reusable components for building robust networking clients and servers.
- https://github.com/hyperium/hyper[Hyper]: A fast and correct HTTP implementation for Rust.

== Known limitations

First of all, please, let us know if you find any limitation or issue to comment on, thanks!

=== Building with OpenSSL crate or using alternatives ===

==== Recommended first approach ====

Most of the crates out there, that require cryptographic related features, come with `openssl` crate as a default dependency feature, but
one can check the crate's docs in regards available features and disable openssl and/or default-features and enable provided alternatives,
like `rustls``.

See some examples of known crates that can be configured to skip requiring OpenSSL C library:

===== SQLx crate without openssl dependency =====

With the https://crates.io/crates/sqlx[sqlx] crate, one can avoid `openssl` dependency by enabling the dependency feature `tls-rustls`
which makes use of the crate `rustls`, like:

```
[dependencies]
sqlx = { version = "0.8", features = [ "runtime-tokio", "tls-rustls", "postgres", "uuid", "json", "chrono", "macros", "migrate" ] }
```

See SQLx's https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/#tls-support[TLS features list support], or https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx?tab=readme-ov-file#cargo-feature-flags[all SQLx feature flags], for further learning.

===== Reqwest crate without openssl dependency =====

With the https://crates.io/crates/reqwest[reqwest] crate, one can avoid `openssl` dependency by enabling the dependency feature `rustls-tls`,
which makes use of the crate `rustls` and disabling default features, like:

```
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.12", default-features = false, features = ["rustls-tls"] }
```

See reqwest's https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/#optional-features[features list] for further learning.

==== Using openssl crate ====

In some cases one might not be able to skip requiring OpenSSL nor LibreSSL C libraries (see https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/issues/1026[issue]), but requires compiling them.

To have a lean compilation and shipping experience with Rust, ODS Jenkins Rust agent provides already the dependencies to build OpenSSL from source and statically link them, hence avoiding any mismatch with existing/multiple OS libraries or none (at build or runtime), by enabling statically linking of the dependency within the binary.

The only missing piece required is to enable the `vendored` feature in the crate in your `Cargo.toml`, see example:

```
[dependencies]
openssl = { version = "0.10", features = ["vendored"] }
```

By doing so, `cargo` will locally build OpenSSL and statically link the openssl dependencies into the binarie(s) generated, hence avoiding any OS existence nor dependency of the openssl library.

==== Alternatives to openssl crate ====

In most of cases, one does not require OpenSSL, indeed it is recommended to use more modern alternatives like:

- https://docs.rs/ring/latest/ring/[ring]
- https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls[rustls]
