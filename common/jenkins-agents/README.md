# Jenkins agents

Hosts all the jenkins agents that are part of the OpenDevStack distribution.

All these agents inherit from the [agent-base](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/tree/master/jenkins/agent-base), and are built in the global `CD` project.

Inside your `jenkinsfile` you can configure which agent is used by changing the `image` property to your imagestream (e.g. in case it's in a `project`-cd namespace and not in the global `CD` one).

```groovy
odsPipeline(
  image: "<dockerRegistry>/<namespace>/jenkins-agent-jdk:<tag>"
```

The ODS [jenkins shared library](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-jenkins-shared-library) takes care about starting the `jenkins agent` during the build as pod in your `project`s `cd` namespace with the `jenkins` service account.
